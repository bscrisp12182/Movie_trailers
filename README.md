# Movie Trailer website
The following Python files will dynamically build a website that displays some of my favorite movies as well as a short summary of each. Clicking on the movie will play the trailer for the movie so you can decide for yourself if you would like to see it.

## Installation
You will need to install Python 2.7 in order to run the code to generate the website.

-------------------------------
**TO INSTALL PYTHON 2.7**

1. Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/) to get the latest version of Python 2.7.
2. Download the appropriate version based on your operating system.
3. Install the downloaded file

-------------------------------

Once that is complete, make sure you have downloaded all three `.py` files included in this repository (`media.py`,`entertainment_center.py`,`fresh_tomatoes.py`) and placed them in a single folder together.

## Usage 
To run the program:

-------------------------------
1. Open IDLE (Python GUI installed with Python 2.7)
2. Go to the **File** pulldown menu and select **Open** then navigate to the folder where the three `.py` files were placed.
3. Select `entertainment_center.py` and hit **Open**
4. To run this module either hit the `F5` key or go to the **Run** pulldown menu and select **Run Module**.
5. Your default browser should open with the generated webpage.
6. Click on a movie to watch the trailer. 
7. Click on the `X` in the upper right corner or on the browser in the background to stop playback and return to the website.
