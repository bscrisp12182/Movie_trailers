# Movie Trailer website
The following Python files will dynamically build a website that displays some of my favorite movies as well as a short summary of each. Clicking on the movie will play the trailer for the movie so you can decide for yourself if you would like to see it.

## Installation
You will need to install Python 2.7 in order to run the code to generate the website.

-------------------------------
**TO INSTALL PYTHON 2.7**

1. Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/) to get the latest version of Python 2.7.
2. Download the appropriate version based on your operating system.
3. Start the install of the downloaded file.
4. In the `Customize Python 2.7.12` menu, scroll down to **Add python.exe to Path** and click on `Will be installed to local hard drive`
5. Finish installation

-------------------------------

Once that is complete, make sure you have downloaded all three `.py` files included in this repository (`media.py`,`entertainment_center.py`,`fresh_tomatoes.py`) and placed them in a single folder together.

## Usage 
To start the program use one of two methods:

-------------------------------
1. Open IDLE (Python GUI installed with Python 2.7)
2. Go to the **File** pulldown menu and select **Open** then navigate to the folder where the three `.py` files were placed.
3. Select `entertainment_center.py` and hit **Open**
4. To run this module either hit the `F5` key or go to the **Run** pulldown menu and select **Run Module**.

**or**

1. Open prompt window. In Windows this can be done by right-clicking on the **Windows tile** and selecting **Command Prompt**
2. Use the `cd` command to change to the directory containing the `.py` program files.
3. Use the command `python entertainment_center.py` to start the program.

-------------------------------

Your default browser should open with the generated webpage. You can then click on a movie to watch the trailer. You can return to the webpage by clicking on the `X` in the upper right corner or on the browser in the background.
